# Code of conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meet-ups are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout each event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk

#Need help?

You can contact the organisers at phpoxford@gmail.com, send a direct message to [@phpoxford](https://twitter.com/phpoxford) on Twitter or speak to an organiser, in person, at an event.

The current organisers are:

* Dan McInerney ([@techgubbins](https://twitter.com/techgubbins))
* Gareth Ellis ([@garethellis](https://twitter.com/garethellis))
* Nils Luxton ([@nilsluxton](https://twitter.com/nilsluxton))
* Oliver Lorton ([@olorton](https://twitter.com/olorton))

If you have a complaint that involves an organiser, you can contact one of the others in confidence. The group is the priority and steps will be taken to ensure the group is successful.

PHPOxford is part of a larger community of PHP User Groups, around the world. If you feel your complaint requires external arbitration, let one of the organisers know and we can discuss the issue with the organisers of those User Groups.

## The quick version

Our meetups are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup.

## The less quick version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup staff immediately.

Meetup staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at meetup and workshop venues and meetup-related social events.
